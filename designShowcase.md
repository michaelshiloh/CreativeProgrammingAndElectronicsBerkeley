Joshua Rafael Sanchez: Sound Experience (sound.exp) dissembles the aspects of a song and transforms them into components of art. Using the tools of Processing coding and Arduino robotics, the project allows the participant to change what they see in front of them with only a click or a slight movement of a part. Use this program with any MP3 file, and see your music come to life!

Zarah Taufique: In the United States, showering and bathing are the most significant indoor uses of water domestically at a whopping 27%. Access to water is often taken granted, and the Earth's supply of water is rapidly dwindling. Knowing this and from observing my family's water habits, I decided to create a Smart Shower that tracks the amount of time you have to take a shower.

Megan Ju: Have you ever wanted to create something in collaboration with an autonomous robot? This project allows you to control the look and feel of the overall art piece while working with the always roaming robot! Flip the switch, change the lighting, turn the potentiometer or knob, or yell near the computer's microphone to change anything about the piece. Make sure to save it and show all your friends!

Divyanshu Bhadoria: My project is a game where you control the growth of a tree. Your goal is to catch as many birds as you can before you reach the top using your two controls, a potentiometer and photoresister. The potentiometer control your angle of growth, while the photoresistor controls your speed.

Norman Chao: My final project is a game/interactive experience called "Sunset Cruise". It's a relaxing, late night driving experience, where you drive a car on an empty stretch of the highway to chill, lo-fi hip hop music. During the drive, you can choose between 7 different songs from the radio and you can cycle between them as you wish. All of the art is drawn with code in Processing (except for the title screen logo, the play button, and the car) and you control the car and the radio using Arduino input.

Josh Mao: Chromesthesia or sound-to-color synesthesia is a type of synesthesia in which sound involuntarily evokes an experience of color, shape, and movement. And while many piano players have hints of this condition, including me, we rarely can fully flesh out the grand multitude of colors that a piano piece creates when we are playing it. I wanted to undertake this project to create a fully functional, piano visualizer that utilizes LEDs to create an artificial "chromesthesia"; by hooking up microphone input to processing and my arduino to a strip of LEDs, I was able to design and engineer an interactive auditory and visual experience that can be enjoyed by professional piano players to beginners who have never touched an instrument before.

Austin Chang: The goal of this project was to focus on creating a full interactive experience using Arduino and Processing. The basic premise is using Arduino to power a vehicle and the OpenCV library on Processing to image processing on a user's face with a webcam. Both are controlled using the WASD keys on a keyboard. Each key press will move the vehicle in a certain direction and also trigger an image change to whatever the webcam picks up.

Ellen Kwok: Has your daily life under a pandemic stress you out? Would you like to look at some fish swimming around and just relax? Enjoy this piece of interactive art where you can sit back and look at Koi fish at home!

Kahini Achrekar: Translating a digital canvas to physical interpretation, this art robot combines Processing input and Arduino outputs to create a collaboration between user and robot. With a mouse controlled canvas, the robot moves by interpreting and responding to onscreen motion and applying its own signature as defined by the rules of the program. The robot can accomodate a variety of drawing and painting tools and bridges the realms of digital and physical art.

Chearim Park: If you love nature but don't have a green thumb, you might need the help of Ada, my smart planter. She uses data from a soil moisture sensor and a temperature sensor to determine if your plant needs more sunlight, water, or the opposite. The different animated faces are what cue the user of your plant's status. The name Ada is a tribute to the adafruit library and Ada Lovelace.

Josue Esquivel: My project consists of a security system capable of detecting human presence. In order to obtain access past an entrance, the human detected will be prompted to enter an appropriate passcode. The system will respond accordingly and dictate if access is granted.

Clarissa Wu: This is an interactive kinetic sculpture inspired by ocean waves where the "Wave" is initiated by the perceiver. Once the viewer is detected to have waved towards the sculpture's ultrasonic distance sensor, the servos and LED neopixels are initiated to create wave like motions. A digital wave display on Processing also starts. The motion of the physical wave is geneterated by a curved wire being rotated by the servo. A mesh cloth hung by strings is tied to different curves on the wire to rise and fall in different heights and amplitudes.

Sean Sada: This project was my final project for the Design Innovation 23 class. The goal was to create a visualizer that utilized information from the three sensors on board the arduino and communicate their values to create artwork in Processing. The end result was a mobile robot that automatically mapped your room and provide feedback visually with a 3D model of cubes made of cubes. This was achieved by first making the robot able to interact with its environment and the be able to communicate the information from the sensors into processing. I then sent these values and information over to processing via a serial port and in real-time you could see how the movement and inputs of the robot and its sensors led to a visual experience. For a better understanding the referenced youtube video I made is a good place to start.

Veronica Raga: My project is a sound automated night light. It uses a sound sensor to detect noise as well as a photoresistor which determines if the lamp should be turned on or off. If it is dark and there is a sound detected, the lamp will be turned on. If it is bright, the lamp won’t be turned on. This prevents the lamp from being turned on unintentionally. I also added buttons to allow the light to be controlled manually. The sound and brightness sensors signal the servo motor, which is attached over the lamp's switch. When the servo rotates to the right, the lamp is turned on and when it rotates to the righ, the lamp is turned off.

Adyah Rastogi: This program creates a relaxing and calming forest that keeps growing! Use a potentiometer & and a photoresistor to have some fun and change up the look of the trees, or simply watch the trees grow as time passes. Each and every one of the trees are unique and grow similar to real trees! Using a photoresistor, you can simulate different amounts of light a tree receives. You can also use a potentiometer to simulate conditions the tree grows in, such as wind, as the potentiometer influences the direction of the growth! Look out for the rare trees that have several colors of flowers :) [Video presentation](https://youtu.be/H3ye7SDC-cU) or [full project documentation](https://github.com/adyahrastogi/creativeProgrammingAndElectronics/blob/master/finalProjectSummer2020/README.md) | <img src="https://github.com/adyahrastogi/creativeProgrammingAndElectronics/raw/master/finalProjectSummer2020/treeGrowthFinalPic.png" width="1700">
